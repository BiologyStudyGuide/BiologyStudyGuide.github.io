  <p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Carbs: 1:2:1 ratio (C:H:O) (monosaccharide & polysaccharide) also table sugar C12H22O11 is also a carb, but it does not follow the rule. Can be broken down for chemical energy. Short term storage. Monomer – monosaccharides. Polymer – polysaccharide.</p> 

<p>Lipids: Glycerol head and fatty acid tails (fatty acids and triglycerides). It is long term storage and stores more than carbohydrates. Polymer – triglyceride. Special type: phospholipid.</p>
<p>Proteins: Carbon center connected to a hydrogen, carboxyl group (COOH), amino group(H2N), and R group (Amino acids and polypeptides). It has a lot of functions (enzyme, transport, signaling, etc.)</p>
<p>Nucleic Acids: Phosphate group, carbon ring, nitrogen base (DNA, RNA, ATP) (Nucleotides)

<p>Enzymes lower the activation energy needed for the reaction. They are proteins so they can denature if the pH and temperature are changed.</p>

  <p>Enzymes work 2 ways, the lock and key and the Induced fit. </p>
<p>The lock and key method are when the substrate fits exactly in the enzyme activity zone, and it was the method that scientist's thought was the only one for many years. </p>
<p>Induced fit is the theory where the substrate changes to fit into the enzyme where it can bond. It was suggested by Daniel Koshland in 1958. </p>
<p>Water stuff:</p>
<p>•	cohesive behavior – Water molecules stick together.</p>
<p>•	ability to moderate temperature - Water has a high specific heat</p>
<p>•	expansion upon freezing - Water decreases in density after freezing</p>
<p>•	versatility as a solvent – Water is known as the universal solvent due to its polarity.</p>
<p>•	hydrogen bonding and polarity – Hydrogen bonds made between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms in H2O the oxygen is slightly negative, and the hydrogens are slightly positive</p>

  <p>NOTES: 
<p>History of cell theory:</p>
<p>In 1665, Robert Hooke used a three-lens compound microscope and when examining tree cork found tiny hollow compartments which he named cells. </p>
<p>Around the same time, Anton van Leeuwenhoek made a single lens microscope as strong as the compound microscope. He became one of the first people to describe living cells when he observed single celled organisms in a pond of water.</p>
<p>As the microscope improved, it became easier to see greater magnification, making scientists wonder where cells come from.</p>
<p>German scientist Matthias Schleiden used a compound microscope and created the theory that plants were made of cells. When he worked with another scientist named Theodor Schwann, Schwann noticed similar structures in plant and animal cells. This made him publish the theory that all living things are made of cells which set the groundwork for later theories. But he thought cells form spontaneously while German scientist Rudolf Virchow proved him wrong saying all cells come from preexisting cells. </p>
<p>Cell Theory:</p>
<p>1.	All living things are made up of cells
<p>2.	Cells are the most basic unit of life
<p>3.	All cells come from pre-existing cells
<p>Structures of CELLS:

  <table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Found in Plant Cells</th>
    <th>Found in Both</th>
    <th>Found in Animal Cells</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>1-<b>Chloroplast</b>- Organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Outer and inner membrane, sacs are called thylakoids containing chlorophyll, a light absorbing molecule that gives it its green color and plays a key role in photosynthesis. This also has its own DNA and ribosomes and the same theory with mitochondria is also valid for this. Plants have both Mitochondria and Chloroplast.</p>
      <p>2-<b>Cell Wall</b>-Surrounds the cell membrane and forms a rigid layer that gives protection, support, and shape to the cell. Made of cellulose and polysaccharide in plants, chitin in fungi, and peptidoglycan in bacteria.</p></td>
    <td><p>1-<b>Cytoplasm</b>- Fluid that fills space between nucleus and cell membrane. Fluid portion is called cytosol and is mostly water.</p>
      <p>2-<b>Cytoskeleton</b> (Already talked about)</p>
    <p>3-<b>Vesicles</b>- Used to deliver materials from place to place. Short lived and recycled. Comes from ER and uses transport to Golgi from ER.</p>
    <p>4-<b>Nucleus</b>-Storage for genetic information or DNA. DNA contains genes that are instructions for making protein. Keeps materials that could damage DNA out of nucleus. Double membrane surrounding called nuclear envelope filled with pores allowing molecules to pass between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>5-<b>Nucleolus</b>-Dense region where tiny organelles that make proteins are made.</p>
    <p>6-<b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth)</b>- Network of thin folded membranes. Maze of enclosed space where the inside is called the lumen. This makes proteins and lipids and all it is folded allows it to fit inside a cell. Surface with Ribosomes are called rough ER while the ones that do not and make lipids instead are called the smooth ER. </p>
    <p>7-<b>Ribosome</b>- Tiny organelles that link amino acids together to form proteins. At the site of protein synthesis and active participants of the process. Ribosomes are made of proteins and RNA. Pass through the nuclear pores into cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>8-<b>Centrosome</b>- Small region of cytoplasm that produces microtubules.</p>
    <p>9-<b>Cell Membrane</b>-Semi-Permeable layer that keeps things from coming in or out of a cell</p>
    <p>10-<b>Golgi Apparatus</b>-Closely layered stacks of membrane enclosed spaces that process, sort and deliver protein. </p>
    <p>11-<b>Mitochondria</b>-Supply energy for the cell. Bean shaped with two membranes using chemical reactions to convert the food you eat into energy. Have their own ribosomes and DNA. Suggested that they were originally free-living prokaryotes that were taken in by larger cells to help both survive.</p>
    <p>12-<b>Vacuole</b>-A fluid filled sac used for the storage of materials a cell needs. Most animal cells have small ones while large central ones are in plant ones. When a plant wilts, the leaves shrivel because there is not enough water in the vacuole to support the structure.</p></td>
    <td><p>1-<b>Centriole</b>-Found in the centrosome, these are cylinder shaped organelles made of short microtubules arranged in a circle and they help during cell division to pull apart the DNA. They can be found in some algae but not in plants. They also help organize microtubules to form cilia and flagella.</p>
    <p>2-<b>Lysosome</b>-Membrane bound organelles that contain enzymes. They defend cells from invading bacteria and viruses and break down damaged or worn-out cell parts. Some plant cells have them but fewer than in animal cells. They are formed in the rough ER inactive but when packaged and activated they need a membrane to keep them from destroying necessary things.</p></td>
