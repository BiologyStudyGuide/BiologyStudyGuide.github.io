  <p>Enzymes work 2 ways, the lock and key and the Induced fit. </p>
<p>The lock and key method are when the substrate fits exactly in the enzyme activity zone, and it was the method that scientist's thought was the only one for many years. </p>
<p>Induced fit is the theory where the substrate changes to fit into the enzyme where it can bond. It was suggested by Daniel Koshland in 1958. </p>
<p>Water stuff:</p>
<p>•	cohesive behavior – Water molecules stick together.</p>
<p>•	ability to moderate temperature - Water has a high specific heat</p>
<p>•	expansion upon freezing - Water decreases in density after freezing</p>
<p>•	versatility as a solvent – Water is known as the universal solvent due to its polarity.</p>
<p>•	hydrogen bonding and polarity – Hydrogen bonds made between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms in H2O the oxygen is slightly negative, and the hydrogens are slightly positive</p>

  <p>NOTES: 
<p>History of cell theory:</p>
<p>In 1665, Robert Hooke used a three-lens compound microscope and when examining tree cork found tiny hollow compartments which he named cells. </p>
<p>Around the same time, Anton van Leeuwenhoek made a single lens microscope as strong as the compound microscope. He became one of the first people to describe living cells when he observed single celled organisms in a pond of water.</p>
<p>As the microscope improved, it became easier to see greater magnification, making scientists wonder where cells come from.</p>
<p>German scientist Matthias Schleiden used a compound microscope and created the theory that plants were made of cells. When he worked with another scientist named Theodor Schwann, Schwann noticed similar structures in plant and animal cells. This made him publish the theory that all living things are made of cells which set the groundwork for later theories. But he thought cells form spontaneously while German scientist Rudolf Virchow proved him wrong saying all cells come from preexisting cells. </p>
<p>Cell Theory:</p>
<p>1.	All living things are made up of cells
<p>2.	Cells are the most basic unit of life
<p>3.	All cells come from pre-existing cells
<p>Structures of CELLS:

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>1-<b>Chloroplast</b>- Organelles that carry out photosynthesis. Outer and inner membrane, sacs are called thylakoids containing chlorophyll, a light absorbing molecule that gives it its green color and plays a key role in photosynthesis. This also has its own DNA and ribosomes and the same theory with mitochondria is also valid for this. Plants have both Mitochondria and Chloroplast.</p>
      <p>2-<b>Cell Wall</b>-Surrounds the cell membrane and forms a rigid layer that gives protection, support, and shape to the cell. Made of cellulose and polysaccharide in plants, chitin in fungi, and peptidoglycan in bacteria.</p></td>
    <td><p>1-<b>Cytoplasm</b>- Fluid that fills space between nucleus and cell membrane. Fluid portion is called cytosol and is mostly water.</p>
      <p>2-<b>Cytoskeleton</b> (Already talked about)</p>
    <p>3-<b>Vesicles</b>- Used to deliver materials from place to place. Short lived and recycled. Comes from ER and uses transport to Golgi from ER.</p>
    <p>4-<b>Nucleus</b>-Storage for genetic information or DNA. DNA contains genes that are instructions for making protein. Keeps materials that could damage DNA out of nucleus. Double membrane surrounding called nuclear envelope filled with pores allowing molecules to pass between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>5-<b>Nucleolus</b>-Dense region where tiny organelles that make proteins are made.</p>
    <p>6-<b>Endoplasmic Reticulum (Rough and Smooth)</b>- Network of thin folded membranes. Maze of enclosed space where the inside is called the lumen. This makes proteins and lipids and all it is folded allows it to fit inside a cell. Surface with Ribosomes are called rough ER while the ones that do not and make lipids instead are called the smooth ER. </p>
    <p>7-<b>Ribosome</b>- Tiny organelles that link amino acids together to form proteins. At the site of protein synthesis and active participants of the process. Ribosomes are made of proteins and RNA. Pass through the nuclear pores into cytoplasm.</p>
    <p>8-<b>Centrosome</b>- Small region of cytoplasm that produces microtubules.</p>
    <p>9-<b>Cell Membrane</b>-Semi-Permeable layer that keeps things from coming in or out of a cell</p>
    <p>10-<b>Golgi Apparatus</b>-Closely layered stacks of membrane enclosed spaces that process, sort and deliver protein. </p>
    <p>11-<b>Mitochondria</b>-Supply energy for the cell. Bean shaped with two membranes using chemical reactions to convert the food you eat into energy. Have their own ribosomes and DNA. Suggested that they were originally free-living prokaryotes that were taken in by larger cells to help both survive.</p>
    <p>12-<b>Vacuole</b>-A fluid filled sac used for the storage of materials a cell needs. Most animal cells have small ones while large central ones are in plant ones. When a plant wilts, the leaves shrivel because there is not enough water in the vacuole to support the structure.</p></td>
    <td><p>1-<b>Centriole</b>-Found in the centrosome, these are cylinder shaped organelles made of short microtubules arranged in a circle and they help during cell division to pull apart the DNA. They can be found in some algae but not in plants. They also help organize microtubules to form cilia and flagella.</p>
    <p>2-<b>Lysosome</b>-Membrane bound organelles that contain enzymes. They defend cells from invading bacteria and viruses and break down damaged or worn-out cell parts. Some plant cells have them but fewer than in animal cells. They are formed in the rough ER inactive but when packaged and activated they need a membrane to keep them from destroying necessary things.</p></td>

  <p>Passive Transport:
<p>Passive transport can be through Osmosis or Diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of fluid or gas where places from high concentration to low concentration while Osmosis is the movement of water from high concentration to low concentration of water. There are 3 types of solutions isotonic, hypertonic, or hypotonic. Isotonic solutions occur when there is the same amount of a solute both in and outside of the cell. Hypotonic solutions are when there is less of a solute outside the cell, so water moves inside. The result is a bursting cell. Hypertonic is the opposite of hypotonic, in which water moves outside of the cell, causing it to shrivel. Molecules that have a hard time use facilitated diffusion using transport proteins to move certain molecules.</p>
<p>Active Transport:</p>
<p>There is active transport where it mostly uses chemical energy. There are two types, Endocytosis and Exocytosis. The first is the entering of chemicals into a cell while the second is the release of chemicals out of a cell. Part of endocytosis is phagocytosis and pinocytosis. Phagocytosis is engulfing solid material while pinocytosis is liquid. </p>

<p>Cellular Respiration: </p>

<p>C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H20 + energy </p>

<p>Steps: </p>

<p>Glycolysis -> In cytoplasm, anaerobic, separates glucose into 2 pyruvates (net yield: 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP and 2 NADH) </p>

<p>Pyruvate oxidation (intermediate step) -> Pyruvate transported into mitochondria, oxidized into acetyl CoA </p>

<p>Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) -> In the mitochondrial matrix, aerobic, inputs acetyl CoA and outputs 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, with CO2 as a byproduct. </p>

<p>Electron Transport Chain & Chemiosmosis-> In inner mitochondrial membrane, aerobic, Electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 into protein complexes in electron carriers. These are used to pump out protons through ATP synthase. This makes ATP. Water is a product </p>

<p>NET: 30-38 ATP </p>
 <p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/W3W34Hf/Picture9.png" alt="Picture9" border="0"></p>     
  <p>Fermentation: (when there is no oxygen available)
<p>Lactic Acid Fermentation: Occurs in muscle cells, makes 2 ATP and lactic acid as a byproduct, buildup of lactic acid causes your muscles to burn</p>
<p>Alcoholic fermentation: Occurs in some bacteria and yeast, makes 2 ATP and ethanol(alcohol) a byproduct.</p>
<p>Photosynthesis:</p>
<p>6CO2 + 6H20 -(light) → C6H12O6 + 6O2</p>
<p>Light reaction: Light splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Oxygen is released.</p>
<p>Dark reaction (Calvin Cycle): No light needed, Carbon dioxide is broken down, ATP is used to make glucose from the broken down C02 and hydrogens</p>
<p>Remember, the dark reaction occurs ALL throughout the day, not just in the absence of light. Both reactions are needed to produce glucose. </p>
<p>The energy of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is released when the link between the second and third phosphate groups is severed. The connection between the two is unstable and breaking it releases energy. When it breaks, it becomes adenosine diphosphate (ADP). ADP can become ATP again if the third phosphate group is added back. This means that the ADP is always recycled, and ATP is a temporary state.</p>

<p>Mitosis: </p>
<p>Interphase – PMAT - Cytokinesis</p>
<p>Interphase: G1, S, and G2 phases. In S phase, the DNA is duplicated.</p>
<p>Prophase: Chromosome's form, nucleus dissolves, centrioles move to poles, spindle fibers form</p>
<p>Metaphase: Chromosomes line up in the middle, Centromeres attach to the spindle fibers</p>
<p>Anaphase: Chromosomes are pulled apart and in the end cytokinesis begins. </p>
<p>Telophase: New nuclear membranes form, chromosomes uncoil, spindle fibers break down.</p>
<p>Cytokinesis: completes the cycle by dividing the two cells. Cleavage furrow in animal cells and cell plates in plant cells</p>

<p>Cancer</p>
<p>•	Mutation in the DNA when duplicating it can be harmful, though most of the mutations are minor and most mutated cells are killed by the body’s immune system. Some do not become cancer cells. Cancer cells duplicate unrestrictedly and therefore faster than regular cells which means that they are dangerous. </p>
<p>•	Benign tumors = mostly good, does not spread and invade organs</p>
<p>•	Malignant tumors = Bad, spreads and invades organs and stuff</p>
<p>•	Carcinogens- anything that causes cancer; Ex. Viruses (15% of all human cancers), UV radiation (leading cause of skin cancer), chemicals (such as ones in food; cooking foods at elevated temperatures)</p>
<p>•	Cancer is dangerous because it makes the body give nutrients to it without providing anything back to said body.</p>
<p>Mutations that lead to cancer usually occur in genes that control the cell cycle. These include tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.</p>
<p>1.	Tumor-suppressor genes normally prevent cells with damaged DNA from dividing. Mutations in these genes prevent them from functioning normally. As a result, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide. Proto-oncogenes normally help control cell division. Mutations in these genes turn them into oncogenes. Oncogenes promote the division of cells with damaged DNA.</p>

      <p>NOTES:</p>
<p>Nervous system: CNS (central) and PNS</p>
<p>The nervous system consists of 2 parts. The Central Nervous System and the Peripheral nervous system.</p>
<p>Central: Brain, Spinal cord, receives, interprets, and sends signals to the PNS</p>
<p>Peripheral: Network of nerves that connect the CNS to the organs, uses sensory and motor neurons to detect stimuli and signal organs and muscles to act/react.</p>
<p>Cerebrum: The 4 lobes of brain, interpret signals from the body, right controls left and left controls right, outer layer is the cerebral cortex</p>
<p>Cerebellum: That thing that looks like a ball of yarn, coordinates movements</p>
<p>Brain Stem: involuntary actions, mid brain=reflexes, pons=breathing, passes signals from spinal cord, medulla oblongata=controls life-sustaining heart functions, vomiting, swallowing, and coughing.</p>
<p>Identifying them:</p>
     <p> Midbrain – The part above pons</p>
<p>Pons – The bulge part in the brain stem, like an Adams apple in the neck, breathing</p>
<p>Medulla oblongata – Part below the brain, controls heart rate</p>
<p>Spinal Cord: Rope-like bundle of neurons, receives signals and sends them to the brain, reflex arcs (self-explanatory)  </p> 
<p>PNS contains motor and sensory system</p>
<p>Motor: Triggers voluntary and involuntary responses</p>
<p>Sensory: Collects info</p>
<p>Somatic: division that controls voluntary movements “talks to PNS”</p>
<p>Autonomic: division that controls involuntary movements, sympathetic “fight or flight” thing prepares body for stress and action, parasympathetic turns it off (normal stuff happens)</p>
<p>Brain:</p>
<p>Frontal Lobe: reasoning, motor skills, higher level cognition, and expressive (thinking and stuff) language. 	</p>
<p>Parietal Lobe: processing tactile sensory information such as pressure, touch, and pain (sensory)</p>

      <p>Occipital Lobe: interpreting visual stimuli and information (seeing)</p>
      <p style="color:red;">Eyes on the back of your head</p>

      <p>Left side of heart- oxygenated blood coming in from lungs 
<p style="color:green;">Comes in from pulmonary veins > left atrium > mitral valve > left ventricle > atrial valve > aorta > other parts of body  </p>
<p>Right side of heart- deoxygenated blood comes in heart</p>
<p style="color:green;">Comes in from superior and inferior vena cava > right atrium > tricuspid valve > right ventricle > pulmonary valve > pulmonary artery > lungs</p>
<p>Pathways of blood:</p>
<p>Blood has two different paths that meet at the heart. These are called pulmonary and systemic circulation. All blood travels on both paths. </p>
<p>Pulmonary Circulation- Occurs between the heart and lungs and main function is to carry oxygen poor blood to the lung and pick up the O2 to carry back to the heart. </p>
<p>Systemic Circulation- Between the heart and the rest of the body to carry oxygen to all the cells and transport poor blood back to the heart. In extreme conditions, the systems can serve vital functions in making sure the vital organs stay at a constant temperature. </p>

      <p>Plasma- mostly water/has glucose, amino acids, salts, hormones, blood proteins, and antibodies</p>
<p>Red Blood Cells- made in bone marrow, main function: carry oxygen, contains hemoglobin (pigment that contains iron and attaches to oxygen), broken down by liver, spleen, and bone marrow</p>
<p>Platelets- small fragments of cells with no nucleus, made in bone marrow, aids in blood clotting</p>

<p>Factors affecting blood flow:</p>
<p>Blood pressure: Increased blood pressure = increased blood flow = smaller blood vessels      Decreased blood pressure = decreased blood flow = larger blood vessels</p>
<p>Blood pressure is the force the blood pushes against the wall and a healthy pressure for a resting young adult is 120 over 70 millimeters of mercury. 120 is known as the systolic pressure which is the amount of pressure on the artery walls when the left ventricle contracts. 70 is known as diastolic pressure which is the pressure in the artery when the left ventricle relaxes. These changes are based on the elastic and unblocked arteries and the strength of the heart. The less elastic and more blockage the harder the blood flow and harder the heart pumps raising blood pressure. Stress and strong emotions can also make it rise but it drops with rest. Permanent high pressure is called hypertension which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. A stroke is where the blood flow to the brain is interrupted, and a heart attack is where the arteries are damaged or blocked.</p> 
<p>Lifestyle affects it since smoking, lack of exercise, excessive weight, and long-term stress, and a diet low in fruits and veggies and high in saturated fats increase the risk of circulatory diseases. Diseases affect the heart. To reduce the risk physicians, urge people to not smoke, remain a healthy weight, and exercise regularly. </p>


<p>Blood volume: Usually varies little, Increased volume = increased flow, decreased volume = decreased flow</p>
<p>Resistance: Increased thickness/viscosity = increased resistance = decreased blood flow           Decreased thickness/viscosity = decreased resistance = increased blood flow.</p>
<p> Exercise: Increased exercise = widened blood vessels =increased blood flow</p>
<p>•	Disease: see below</p>
<p>o	Atherosclerosis: Where plaque builds up in your arteries, casing decreased blood flow = increased blood pressure, cause heart attack, stroke, or death, thickening and hardening of the walls of the arteries</p>
<p>o	Polycythemia Vera: Rare disease that makes your body make too many red blood cells, thicker blood, more blood clots, cause heart attack or stroke</p>
<p>o	High Salt intake: Increased volume of water in the red blood cells, increasing the total amount of blood in the blood vessels, increased blood pressure, speeds up buildup of plaque in blood vessels, may injure blood vessels, tires out heart by making it work harder</p>
<p>o	Heart Disease: Coronary artery disease (CAD) happens when the arteries become hardened and narrowed due to atherosclerosis. This causes less blood to flow, which can cause heart attack</p>
<p>Immune System:</p>
<p>The immune system protects the body from invading pathogens</p>
<p>Non-specific immune system:</p>
<p>1st line of defense: Skin and Mucous membranes</p>
<p>2nd line of defense: White blood cells</p>
<p>Mast and Basophil cause inflammation from histamine </p>
<p>Neutrophil = phagocyte (engulfs invading cells) virus, bacteria, fungus 	</p>
<p>Macrophage = phagocyte (engulfs damaged body cells and virus, bacteria, fungi) called a monocyte when in blood...enters tissue and becomes macrophage. </p>
<p>Lymphocyte = </p>
<p>o T cells = disintegrates infected cells </p>
<p>o B cells = makes inactivation proteins/antibodies and inactivates pathogens that have not yet reached healthy cells.</p>
<p>Eosinophil = injects poisonous “packets” into parasites</p>
<p>B cells:</p>
<p>•	Normal B cells act as APCs</p>
<p>•	Plasma B cell- creates antibodies</p>
<p>•	Memory B cell- long living cell that protects and monitors from the same pathogen</p>
<p>Types of T cells: killer (cytotoxic) T cell, helper T and memory T</p>
<p>1.	Memory T cells – Remains long term after the infection happened. Can turn into effector T cells if the same pathogen enters the body again</p>
<p>2.	Effector T cells – T cells that are trained to search for a specific antigen and cause the cells with the antigen to perform apoptosis.</p>
<p>3.	Helper T cells- aid B cells in production of antibodies and help killer T cells, work in the lymph nodes and site of infection</p>
<p>Uses - </p>
<p>Antibodies: Inactivates pathogen, clumps pathogens, activates complement proteins </p>
<p>Complement proteins: weaken pathogen’s cell membrane (lyses the cell), attract phagocytes, trap microbes to blood vessel walls</p>
<p>Interferons: Warns neighboring cells of the virus, causes infected cells to perform apoptosis, activates immune cells</p>
<p>Specific immune system:</p>
<p>3rd line of defense: Antibodies are made to match a specific antigen invading the body. </p>
<p>Passive Immunity: mechanisms existed before infection, passed between generations, genetic </p>
<p>Active Immunity: occurs after the pathogen has bypassed the 1st line of defense includes </p>
<p>Acquired Immunity which is a resistance developed after initial exposure.</p>
<p>Antibiotics kill bacteria and fungi, risk of resistance if used often.</p>
<p>Vaccines allow production of memory cells by giving exposure without sickness, usually a disabled pathogen or the antigen. </p>
<p>Types:</p>
<p>•	Dead viruses or bacteria </p>
<p>•	Live attenuated (weakened living pathogen) </p>
<p>•	Component (use components or parts of the pathogen...e.g., protein coat of a virus) </p>
<p>•	Toxoid (inactivated bacteria toxins)</p>
<p>Ways of transmission: Airborne, droplets, skin contact</p>
<p>More info:</p>
<p>•	Autoimmune disease- condition where one’s immune system attacks one’s own tissues</p>
<p>•	Innate immunity- generalized immune response; nonspecific</p>
<p>•	Adaptive immunity- antigen specific response; memory</p>
<p>•	Barrier immunity (first line of defense) is part of innate immunity</p>
<p>•	Types of barriers: mechanical barriers (physically block pathogens from entering, ex. skin and mucus membranes), biological barriers (living organisms that help protect the body’s linings, ex. harmless bacteria on the skin’s exterior) and chemical barriers (enzymes that kill pathogens, ex. sweat, mucus, stomach acid (hydrochloric acid), saliva & tears)</p>
<p>•	B cells are produced in the bone marrow</p>
<p>•	T cells are produced in the thymus</p>
<p>•	Nonspecific defense- keeps out any type of microbe</p>
<p>•	Specific defense- attacks a specific microbe one type at a time</p>
<p>•	Inflammation- chemicals released by damaged tissues; increased blood flow, phagocytic white blood cells arrive</p>
<p>•	Neutralization- make a pathogen inactive, so it cannot cause infection</p>
<p>•	Proliferation- rapid multiplication</p>
<p>•	Cytokines- regulate inflammation</p>
<p>•	APCs- antigen presenting cells</p>
<p>•	Dendritic cell- an APC that gathers antigens and brings them to the lymph nodes</p>
<p>Types of Pathogens</p>
<p>•	Bacteria- single celled organisms without a nucleus (Ex. E coli)</p>
<p>•	Viruses- nonliving particles that take over living cells (Ex. Coronavirus)</p>
<p>•	Protozoa- single celled organisms with a nucleus (Ex. Giardia lamblia)</p>
<p>•	Fungi- simple organisms including mushrooms and yeasts that grow as single cells or thread like filaments (Ex. Death cap mushroom)</p>
<p>Factors that cause disease:</p>
<p>1.	Inherited</p>
<p>2.	Pathogens</p>
<p>3.	Pollutants and poisons</p>
<p>4.	Organ malfunction</p>
<p>5.	Bad lifestyles</p>
<p>Steps to Nonspecific Response:</p>
<p>•	Pathogen breaks through first line of defense</p>
<p>•	Mast cells start producing histamines</p>
<p>•	Increased fluid and blood flow occurs resulting in inflammation</p>
<p>•	White blood cells engulf and eat pathogens</p>
<p>•	Increased activity can cause a fever; a fever will help slow the growth of pathogens</p>
<p>Cellular Immunity:</p>
<p>1. Macrophage engulfs infected cells </p>
<p>2. Presents the antigen on its surface </p>
<p>3. T-cell attached to the antigen </p>
<p>4. More T cells produced (memory T’s and activation T’s) </p>
<p>5. Activation T’s go on to lyse any cell presenting that Ag. </p>
<p>Humoral Immunity:</p>
<p>1. Uses antibodies (Ab) which inactivate, clump, or burst infected cells. </p>
<p>2. Pathogen binds to B cell and B cell engulfs it </p>
<p>3. B cell “presents” Ag </p>
<p>4. T cell binds Ag and activates the B cell </p>
<p>5. B cell divides into memory B’s and activated B’s (activated B’s can produce over 1000 Ab’s in a second) </p>
<p>6. Phagocytes engulf and destroy the pathogens </p>

      <p>How Eggs are developed:</p>
	<p>The eggs, produced before a female is born, are produced inside the ovaries. When a female baby is born, she already has 2 million potential egg cells. After puberty, which is triggered by a hormone called Estrogen, which is produced in the ovaries, each month an egg would mature and travel through the fallopian tube. Since the egg is slow traveling, it takes several days to travel down the fallopian tube. </p>
<p>How Sperms are developed:</p>
	<p>For males, puberty is the time sperms are produced. Each testis contains hundreds of tiny tubules where millions of sperm cells are produced. Unlike females, males continue to produce sperm for the rest of their life. </p>
<p>Fetal development:</p>
<p style="color:blue;">Fertilization (zygote)-cell division-blastocyst-embryo-fetus (order)</p>
<p>After the egg cell is fertilized, it becomes a zygote, which undergoes mitotic division as it travels to the uterus. Once it becomes a blastocyst (a hollow ball of cells) and implants itself on the uterine lining. Once differentiation begins, the zygote becomes an embryo. </p>
<p>Maternal and fetal blood do not mix.</p>
<p>Amniotic Sac: fluid filled and cushions embryo...prevents sudden temperature changes. </p>
<p>Chorion membrane: nourishes embryo and has villi that extends into uterine lining </p>
<p>Placenta: connection to maternal blood...oxygen, nutrients, and waste. </p>
<p>Umbilical cord: 2 arteries + 1 vein, fetal blood supply.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/9nMkrmG/Picture17.png" alt="Picture17" border="0"></p>
      <p>38 weeks (about 8 and a half months) of development from zygote to fully formed fetus. </p>
<p>This is split up into 3 trimesters (~3 months each).</p>
<p>1st Trimester: Heartbeat in 5 weeks, vertebrae and spinal cord begin developing, arms legs and fingers start forming, now called fetus, main organs start to form at this stage. (Placenta and umbilical cord also develop) </p>
<p>2nd Trimester: Heartbeat heard via stethoscope, Brain grows fast, mother can feal movement, fingers and toes fully develop, swallows' amniotic fluid, and makes urine</p>
<p>3rd Trimester: Lungs fully developed, grows to largest size – 7-9 pounds, bones grow and harden, eyes open when awake and closed when asleep. Babies born prematurely at the start of the third have a hard time surviving while babies born toward the middle to end often survive and thrive. At the last month, the lungs are strengthened and the fetus sucks in and pushes out of the amniotic fluid. (Water breaks, child breathing)</p>

      <p>Notes:</p>
<p>Nucleotides: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) </p>
<p>Also, if asked to find a complementary base sequence for DNA think </p>
<p>Apples in the Tree & Car in the Garage </p>
<p>And in RNA thymine(T) is turned into uracil(U)</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/SK8G4r7/Picture18.png" alt="Picture18" border="0"></p>
<p>Chargaff’s rule: Percentage of Adenine is equal to percentage of Thymine. Percentage of Cytosine is equal to the percentage of Guanine </p>
<p>Ex: A=20% so T=20% so G=30% so C=30% </p>
<p>Purines are adenine and guanine (Apples in the Garage). Pyrimidines are thymine, uracil, and cytosine (Cars Under the Tree). Purines have two rings and pyrimidines have one ring.</p>
<p>Important people:</p>
<p>Frederick Griffith: He discovered a “transforming principle” that changes harmless R bacteria to change into harmful S bacteria.</p>
<p>Oswald Avery: Discovered DNA as the cause of the “transforming principle”</p>
<p>Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase: Confirmed that DNA was genetic material</p>
<p>James Watson and Francis Crick: Made 3D model of DNA</p>
	<b><u><p>DNA replication:</p></u></b>
<p>•	Helicase unzips the DNA by breaking the fragile hydrogen bonds, creating a replication fork.</p>
<p>•	DNA primase tells the DNA polymerase where to start and it starts connecting complementary nucleotides together. It goes in a 5’(phosphate) to 3’(carbon), so there will be a lagging strand as shown below.</p>
<p>•	Ligase glues together the Okazaki fragments and two new identical strands of DNA are created. This is known as semi-conservative because each new strand has half of the old strand of DNA in it.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k4nBYPH/Picture19.png" alt="Picture19" border="0"></p>
<b><u><p>Transcription:</p></u></b>
<p>•	A section of DNA is unzipped, and RNA polymerase identifies where to start.</p>
<p>•	RNA polymerase, going in the 5’ to 3’ direction, and pairs the bases, replacing thymine with uracil.</p>
<p>•	Once the entire gene is transcribed, the RNA strand detaches from the DNA and the DNA is zipped back together.</p>
<b><u><p>Translation:</p></u></b>
<p>1.	mRNA enters the ribosomes, and the exposed codon (a triplet of bases) attracts a complementary tRNA.</p>
<p>2.	The ribosome makes a peptide bond between the amino acids and one tRNA goes away.</p>
<p>3.	This repeats until it reaches a stop codon.</p>

      <p>Notes:</p>
<b><u><p>Parts of plant:</p></u></b>
<p>Roots: Gets water and anchors the plant to the ground</p>
<p>Stem: Supports the plant and transports water and nutrients throughout the plant.</p>
<p>Leaf: Performs photosynthesis to make food </p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/4sd7JM0/Picture25.png" alt="Picture25" border="0"></p>    
<p>Cuticle – Protects the plant from the elements. Radiation, drought, injury. Limits evaporation and forms water resistant covering.</p> 
<p>Epidermis – Protects the leaf from water loss. Adds an extra layer of protection. The lower epidermis contains stomata.</p> 
<p>Palisade Cells – Where photosynthesis occurs. Absorbs the light that enters the leaf</p> 
<p>Phloem – Transports food made in the leaves to other parts of the plant. It is a vascular tissue</p> 
<p>Spongy Cells – Allows for interchange of gases that are needed during photosynthesis. It is loosely packed, creating air spaces that allow gas diffusion.</p> 
<p>Stomata – Takes in carbon dioxide and releases oxygen</p> 
<p>Guard Cells – Regulates the opening and closing of stomates. Environmental factors play a role in this.</p> 
<p>Xylem – Transports water from the roots to the leaves. It is a vascular tissue</p> 
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/F6xTShs/Picture26.png" alt="Picture26" border="0"></p>
<p>Anther – Produces Pollen</p>
<p>Pollen grains – Contain gametes needed for fertilization</p>
<p>Filament – Holds the anther up</p>
<p>Ovary – Contains and protects the ovules until they are fertilized</p>
<p>Ovules – Forms seeds after being fertilized.</p>
<p>Petals – Used to attract pollinators. Attracts insects and small animals. Not all flowering plants have brightly colored petals. If the petals of these flowers are reduced or absent, then the plant relies on wind or water for pollination</p>
<p>Sepal – Encloses and protects the developing reproductive structures. Leaf like structures that surround and protect the flower before it blooms. </p>
<p>Receptacle – Part where the flower starts to grow. Part of the branch where the flower forms.</p>
<p>Stigma – Catches pollen to enter the ovary. Is often sticky</p>
<p>Carpels – Female reproductive structures</p>
<p>Pistil – Carpels are fused together to form a pistil. It has three parts: Stigma, style, and ovary</p>
<p>Style – Long tube that attaches the stigma to the ovary</p>
<p>Stamen – Male reproductive structures. Contains two parts: Anther and filament</p>
<p>Fruit – Any structure that encloses and protects a seed. </p>
	<b><p>PLANT REPRODUCTION:</p></b>
<p>A key feature of all plant life cycles is alternation of generations.</p>
<p>Sporophyte: A multicellular diploid (2n) stage. “Spore plant,” meaning a plant that will make spores.</p>
<p>Gametophyte: A multicellular haploid (n) stage. “Gamete plant,” meaning a plant that will make gametes that will eventually fuse to form a zygote. </p>
<p>Gametes (sex cells = egg and sperm) are produced from haploid gametophyte during mitosis. </p>
<p>Meiosis produces spores that will develop into haploid multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Alternation of Generations: </p>
<p>It happens in every multicellular organism</p>
<p>Basically, describes the process between haploid and diploid cells.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xDry4ny/Picture27.png" alt="Picture27" border="0"></p>
<b><u><p>NONVASCULAR REPRODUCTION:</b></u></p>
<p>Gametophyte dominated</p>
<p>Water carries sperm from a male gametophyte to a female gametophyte to facilitate fertilization</p>
<p>After, when the sporophyte forms from mitosis, it remains attached to the gametophyte, relying on it for water and nutrients</p>
<p>Once spores are made, they are dispersed via water (or air if the humidity is high enough) and germinate to yield more gametophytes, and the cycle continues</p>
<b><u><p>VASCULAR REPRODUCTION:</b></u></p>
<u><p>Seedless:
<p>Reproduce most similarly to nonvascular plants</p>
<p>Sporophyte dominated</p>
<p>Spores made by the sporophyte grow on the underside of a fern’s leaf and get released to find a moist patch of ground to germinate on</p>
<p>These spores create a tiny gametophyte from mitoses and has male and female reproductive organs on the underside of the leaf</p>
<p>Sperm on one side finds an egg on the other side and fuse to form the zygote, which develops into the sporophyte.</p>
<u><p>Gymnosperms:</p></u>
<p>Sporophyte dominated</p>
<p>Cones and pollen are key reproductive structures</p>
<p>Pollen grains carry sperm from male cones at the bottom of the upward to fertilize eggs in ovules in the female cones towards the top of the tree</p>
<p>After fertilization, a “naked” seed grows, which will later ripen into a mature plant</p>
<p>Seed provides key nutrients and protection for the growing plant</p>
<p>Pollen gets dispersed by wind and does not need water to reproduce</p>
	<u><p>Angiosperms:</p></u>
<p>Sexual reproduction in angiosperms occur when the pollen from an anther is transferred to the stigma. The pollen moves down the style of the pistil into the ovary. It then fertilizes an ovule, which then develops into a seed. </p>
<p>Sporophyte dominated – Every part of the plant is the sporophyte except for the pollen and ovum in the flower</p>
<p>Flower is the key reproductive structure</p>
<p>Does not need wind or water, pollination strategies are used to attract other organisms to spread pollen to other ovules</p>
<p>After fertilization, the ovule becomes seed, and the ovule becomes fruit (anything the ovary turns into even nuts)</p>
